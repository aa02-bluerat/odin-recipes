    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>        
        <li>1/4 cup marinara sauce</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cherry tomatoes</li> 
        <li>1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li> 
        <li>1/2 cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Step 1</dt>
            <dd>Break each lasagna noodle into 6 rectangular pieces. 
                Place noodles in a 4-cup microwave-safe bowl. 
                Add water, making sure noodles are covered and water level is about halfway up the bowl. 
                Place the bowl on a microwave-safe plate.</dd>
        <dt>Step 2</dt>
            <dd>Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. 
                Stir pasta quickly to keep it from clumping. 
                Cook in 2-minute increments, stirring in between, and emptying any water that has boiled over onto the plate. 
                Repeat until lasagna is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes total. 
                Drain noodles, reserving 1 tablespoon of the cooking liquid. Return noodles and reserved liquid to the bowl.</dd>
        <dt>Step 3</dt>
            <dd>Stir marinara sauce and chopped tomatoes into the bowl, mixing until incorporated. 
                Sprinkle on basil, and then mozzarella cheese. 
                Cover surface of the bowl with a paper towel to prevent splatter and microwave 
                until cheese is completely melted and tomato sauce is warmed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Serve immediately.</dd>
