            This webpage is my first Odin Project! This is continuously a work in progress. Aiming to become a good web developer someday.
            Kindly subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTcj0KknlDxQbcgr5JmcxHA" style="color: red;">YouTube channel</a>. It contains all the stupid things that I love to do in a computer.

                <p class="food-description"> This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
                    Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
                    This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too. </p>

                <p class="food-description">Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, 
                    usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, 
                    such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables.</p>

                <p class="food-description"> Though tastes and preferences differ, the perfect French fry 
                    generally has a crunchy exterior and a light, fluffy interior. 
                    Finding the right balance is tricky, though, as making French fries that 
                    are too crispy will result in a tough exterior that goes beyond crispiness. </p>
